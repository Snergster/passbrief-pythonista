# Project TODO

- [ ] Review the updated workflow table and detailed walkthrough in `docs/onboarding-project-overview.md` during the next practice run; capture any additional onboarding aids a first-time pilot/developer might need.
- [ ] Maintain a running list of glossary terms to add as new jargon appears, so the glossary in `docs/onboarding-project-overview.md` keeps pace with the team's language.
